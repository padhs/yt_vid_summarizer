  "transcript": "hello I think we're recording again just really again no way to tell okay so um right so basically for the past six months I've been building on top of voice AI platforms and um avoiding sort of the lower level Frameworks and some things have emerged that I think make it so that now is the time to sort of try and learn those cuz it could unlock some useful use cases if I'm able to figure out some of the things that I'll show you um so I might as well just actually get to it right so I'm going to try and build something on top of these Frameworks and I've never used them before I have some experience with live kit like from a couple of months ago just basic exploration so if the framework I'm going to use which is called daily is actually in any way similar to that might be helpful but I don't know if it is and I mean I really I've only just had some basic reading of that documentation so I'm not going to really know what's going on here this is going to be like really slow this is a project that's going to take multiple weeks and you know for much of the early days I'm probably not going to be making all that much progress so just to set expectations there you know so anyway on on with the show whatever okay so let show you just something from my LinkedIn which piqu my curiosity and why I think we should be doing doing this so let me just have a look I saved items I'm just going to do this on my other screen because this guy's profile might be private um I've bookmarked a few of his posts actually let just find the one that's interesting here we go so let me just show you this so this is the CEO of daily and there has emerged a approach to turn detection essentially using Gemini 2.0 so just some background on this in case you're not in the voice a space you don't know um live kit like a week or so before this I saw this or maybe actually was about the same time but I called on to this late um released a special endp pointing model that um operates on transcribed text I believe and checks whether or not it's at the end of the sentence based on that there's apparently a new way to do this leveraging um state-of-the-art llms like um J 2.0 the native audio capabilities of that and he's demonstrated something pretty cool which I want to try and emulate today so today's task is basically try and copy this guy so let me just show you actually what he's done hopefully you'll be able to hear this I'm ask you some questions about geography are you ready yes I'm ready what's the what's the capital of France the capital of France is Paris and how how about Germany the capital of Germany is Berlin and the capital of Canada is that uh is that Ottawa yes the capital of Canada is Ottawa okay let's switch gears and test your abilities as a customer support agent are you ready yes I'm ready okay so you get the idea so there's a couple of other things he announced which um is that Gemini 2.0 is very good at tool calling and the other thing is that there's this new visual interface for pipe cat flows which allows you to break up a system prompt effectively or call into different pH phes I'm not too much interested in the visual interface they've created but pipe Gap flows could be quite useful and these three components together could be ingredients to a useful recipe so I'm going to see what I can build with that so he's linked actually in here the code so let's just have a look at this okay well great so that's not perfect is it so okay I was going to just copy that code oh well okay um 22 D okay looks like they've actually come some way since then so let's see if I can get here we go so this looks like this might be the code so let's just see if I can get this working somehow move this daily docks have to install daily for so creating a daily room does actually seem pretty similar to live kit and then the participants join the room so yeah let's see how you install it okay let's just clone this repo what is this exactly pipe cat okay okay so let's just clone this into my Dev directory Dev C and C Okay so maybe just try and run this and see where it breaks would be the best thing to do okay well maybe I'll just make a new directory for this um okay I'm going to just mhm okay all right good one so I haven't actually got access access to Gemini either so that's probably going to be an issue let's just call this right yep cool right okay so now not sure what packages actually sure which packages I need to install but see if we can guess let see actually um perplexity knows hey can you tell me which python packages I need to install to run this could you make me a requirements. text for it and um tell me how to start to create and instate a um VMV for this project by the way it's pipe cat from daily Bots okay okay okay so I've actually seen something like this before in their documentation like when I found it but cool so so that's fine we just need these okay and then pip install okay okay this is using a of good okay well it's doing its thing well how about that that actually seems to have installed most of the stuff Runner okay also getting run me try running again see if it gives an error yep cool also getting that as I get comfortable we're going to be here a while really cold here the runner. py okay hang on Runner Runner not a package yeah well it's not saying from Runner this is the import by the way it's not saying import from do Runner right so it's not expecting something in the same directory be wrong about this I'll have to look at the GitHub can't spell its oh well okay nope okay so it's probably what it's talking about uh ahuh okay yeah okay so it's right on the money actually so there's probably a runner in okay yeah fair enough these AI it does know what it's talking about okay um so let's just go and yeah cool nice one have to review my import syntax as well okay so now hopefully it'll complain about some API keys so it's also interesting that he was when he was talking to it he had a terminal window open rather than a front end so I know with live kit you run the back end which sends an agent to the room and then with the front end you connect to the room and then you talk to it but he seem to be talking to it just wonder if I can just add it as a comb just do this just you okay go open AI does also did say that it needed an API key but let's just sort out one second okay deep gum now why is it asking for deep okay perfect right okay so now I probably need to set up an account with daily and get some kind of key to get the room here does this mean need to get set up with daily if so how do I do that I use perplexity a lot as you might be able to tell at this point seemes me having to remember everything or figure anything out very generous with their usage limits use it to take full advantage of that MH okay okay interesting so let's do what it says just type dashboard just log in with Google okay we'll do okay okay hello okay so I guess that means it it's working get started okay so now what MH okay developer tab okay well that's great that that's shared because and there's no way to revoke that so I'm going to have to edit this out of this video um maybe I should just take this off the screen okay so there's an API key I need to revoke um I'll probably have edited this out of the video This Is Why I'm not doing this live create a new API key and the whole thing just crashed that's interesting not really sure what just happened so click create API key and the whole thing closed okay dashboard okay well I made another API key I can revoke the other can I revoke the other one yes I can great okay as long as I've got one go ahead just I'll make another one I'll revoke them all then no worries so long as I can revoke key that's fine okay and whatever go on mhm okay I've got a few things to set okay no worries so then um so with python can I just can I use a. local with python must be able to pass it as a argument short you okay fine we'll be putting this in GitHub come with made so I'll probably have to I'll make a Don example as well put the actual stuff just the names of the ones I've got to enter here so that to that's interesting curs is good the to complete incursor no guesses there though I think that's actually right um h just going to make a little note that I need to delete I ke to do delete daily room and API Keys before publishing this video okay so let's get the room yep VI key key also delete API delete open AI key okay so I'm going to do this on my second screen h okay um so I'm G to go to open AI somewhere API dashboard API keys so pipe cat tinkering key cesia do I really need a cesia actually it's just try running this I do I even need the API one sorry the open AI one oh it's not even okay I'm not loading the environment variables in the file um okay so okay it was a file load. EnV okay so it's actually trying to load it's just because of the name then so just putv maybe oh wow okay 401 pretty sure that's going to be okay so I'm guessing that's because I need a caresia API key so um I need to sign up for CIA IIA cesia try it out I mean whatever no to sales API Keys have none okay I will be able to delete this obviously at some point right okay so have to just make a note to delete that as well so delete c key so I mean I hope this is all doable otherwise I'll just have to throw this video away wouldn't that be a shame okay Google I'm definitely going to need a Google one hopefully I can actually even access Google's new model from the UK cuz you know it's not always possible okay that's interesting oh h okay but there's a default B so okay maybe on is probably right so I mean why why might that way working I just REM myself can't even remember the ER what the error code means God okay do you think this might be may I key is set is it valid that's a good question 37 minutes so far told you this was going to be slow well I'm sure that cesia the package knows that so let me just run it again see same thing right no not the same thing now it's actually worked how about that maybe I didn't click save before okay well now what okay so it's joined the room let's have a look at the code and see what that's supposed to do so we're running Main and in the main function session audio true okay so wonder why I'm muting I'm hi uping because I've had like lch a little while ago so okay I I would think that I'd need Google API thing I'm not sure how exactly it's supposed to listen to me with a Python scripts right so maybe it would be good to actually okay could you okay could you run me through how a daily demo is supposed to work I'm the script is running now but I think maybe I am supposed to connect with a client which um exposes my microphone for example hope it's understood that daily is actually the platform daily because perplexity hasn't been as smart as usual usually like the past few days but there has been like an update since I had that had issues with it so maybe it's going to work now okay the app we'll find the m so does it mean I have to just go through where I was before like with a test there's a live session respond but okay maybe I can just go to it let actually open Chrome for this can might use Chrome actually going forward just to keep some separation between my um main accounts and these business accounts okay going okay the microphone is just because one okay do that hello anyone there respond but cool okay so clearly it's detecting my um speech here okay great so I mean that's kind of progress isn't it okay okay okay um so I think we need to sort the Google thing out H it's interesting there's no errors considering there's no Google um TTS thing I wonder if I can actually just maybe change it to open AI yeah okay um let's just stop this and do I just can I leave okay is it something missing here okay yeah there's parts of the screen missing leave there we go cool okay I probably need to check how much I can use this for free Okay so all right so let me just have a look so it worked responsive so no errors but I've not yet set where would I get this uh gemin API so let's do this in here okay there from Life kit actually have something okay um I it's going be in here is it okay m okay okay do I want to click this while I'm recording hopefully I'll be able to delete this live yeah yeah I remember I did did actually get that got some tools working and let's just delete that though just not be using that again um create credentials maybe like it unrestricted yeah so for sure we can delete my delete G AP key cleaning up after myself is going to take some time after this apparently so yeah now we've got a key is that it a iq1 lovely now let's see what happens hello can you say anything yes I can certainly say something oh hello awesome holy  that was quite a surprise yes it was how did you know I was surprised oh check qu resource exhausted interesting might need to start billing or something okay wow it's just breaking cool let me just actually leave again okay well this is progress 51 minutes for sure I mean something working there we go um what's up with this ex pretty self-explanatory but but why why do problem solving when you got perplexity yeah qu limits of the genine model so I'm going to have to put some billing in right don't liting is this is this because Google wants my billing details yes okay so for sure I'm going to do this on a different screen um you can still this F can activate keep your Cloud just see what happens here okay oh really $300 in free new credits well I don't think they need my details do they maybe if I just run it now hello anyone there can can you say something I can certainly do that well go on there and tell me a story I'd be glad to do that please continue okay maybe can't possibly have used $300 worth of credits can I okay let me just see if I can sort this out on my other screen little spinner while it's trying to load the account management section slow there was a lot of latency which is pretty concerning with this bot so I'm going to have to look into that and how to even debug that you know it's going to be fascinating so yeah early days to read the error maybe it's the same thing right MH so this is still recording isn't it and still recording the right screen hopefully if I change screen is it cool I think it's actually working okay okay so nothing's happening at all project vers live kit project you what my my billing it's already got my Cod details okay interesting so what's up on the Google project okay so I'm actually seeing a live kit project set up here so maybe I need to separately do whatever this other project was um Google Cloud you're working in first live kit project okay maybe I could rename that I don't think it matters though cuz I've used the API key from this project right and yeah yeah and this is associated with billing so yeah so I definitely need to delete this key at some point okay well oh quota Ed it up quota used up it said didn't it so I might have set a quota um says no restrictions so if I want okay trick qu right okay so go to I am admin might as well just show you this um I am an admin qu is God okay for yeah I don't think I search in the right place um I need to search this oh good one no okay so that's not the right place to search either okay um Gemini oh here we go think maybe uh okay don't actually know which one I want maybe it's in the code Gemini gini 2.0 flash okay here we go what is e FL okay so I mean so it has a separate entry for the free tier and the actual other tier all right so what now actually follow read the instructions right okay might be using one of the I don't even know anything about these Gemini models maybe I should have read about that I mean this might be one of the more expensive ones um I might not even have access like I mean I do obviously have access but h just um what do you think is wrong here is Chul 2.0 a premium model with very low rate limits maybe mhm 10 queries per minute oh oh you know what I wonder if this guy the daily CEO has probably got higher quoters than me okay right oh well okay so I'm going to need probably need to I think that's probably the working hypothesis here I'm going to need to figure out a different approach no worries so um generally speaking perhaps there any other in the family can use with lower limits I'm hoping it's going to say that the 1.5 1.5 flash is the answer to this looking for looking for one that can process audio tokens natively generate yeah process them actually just I mean does it really flash experimental okay well let's try changing these okay but this is the default right think it might maybe be worth checking so I have to have this right in front of my face because otherwise it's the audio doesn't record properly but it's in the way of my keyboard so I'm just looking around to find my Discord just going to check the daily Discord server to see if anyone's asked about this I'm not going to bother them with any questions at this stage due diligence one result okay that was a waste of time probably going to edit that out okay for let's see 1.5 okay actually don't do that um just replace it in this file so let's just do it the old fashioned way multi select 1.5 see what Happ for run this guessing it's not going to work very well hello anyone there Co L okay so this is not a model you can use for this purpose I don't think um Tred switching to 1.5 got this okay actually maybe it's just me being I mean am I huh okay actually you know what right there in the code they very kindly commented out wow I seriously just need to read properly um maybe this will work maybe they very kindly set this up so it's very easy for people if they're paying attention so let's try again hello anyone there hello hello how can I help you how can I help you oh awesome um so I am thinking that i' like it if you told me a story once upon a time in a land far away lived a brave knight who rescued a princess from a dragon cool okay how about this ask me what my phone number is what is your phone number your phone number so it is 013 03 1 2 3 4 56 that's all of it by the way your phone number is 01313 031 2 3 4 56 that's right so I think maybe for the UK numbers it wasn't able to check that okay um how many digits are there in a standard phone number to your knowledge a standard UK phone number has 11 digits digits okay so you know it's a UK phone number interesting okay actually so this is working you know awesome so what I want to do is actually have my own front end actually maybe I'll just okay so this is actually working the back end is sort of working now not bad okay so I don't really want video and all that so now I want to know how to make a front-end client so we've got the back end sort of working actually literally just running this code and setting up some stuff okay so let's just call this something meaningful backend py so I'll be expanding this some point in some way and for example let me prepare this for GitHub for people cut equals I think that'll do whatever I don't actually think you need the deep gum key I don't think you need the I don't think you need the open AI key either let me just actually delete that and on it again and delete this okay good one yeah yeah okay I'm pretty sure it's working fine let me just might as well just have another little chat hello would you like to tell me a joke why don't scientists trust atoms because they make up everything good one latency is a lot better so I guess that the latency issue before was related to the um size of the model perhaps okay so let's see now so we can actually just call this pipe C back end close this okay and front end okay so I'm going to have to okay cool let's see put the back end Jesus so just simple front end that allows me to connect my mic to the room are there any any examples I can probably just look at Daily's guides what do you only okay right here we go this is clearly frontend JavaScript not clearly um no clearly yep jsx so you can build like actually Google meet and stuff in this just go any quick so can you make me actually can you make it for me in JS Style let's go into my little terminal again and pmpm create next app at latest and Dot should give it the current name yes obviously definitely well actually let's not do that anymore obviously and no and let's just leave it cool so cursor dot we have an application okay that's not how it works anymore I want it to be okay cool okay I would like this to be Audio Only strictly please okay so actually perplexity has definitely improved with this new update perfect yep already oh okay actually not perfect because I saw it was explicitly disabled when I read the documents just a second ago but never mind probably doesn't matter I assume know what it's doing knows what it's doing I'll check it obviously but for now just going to get something working okay you're not going to give me the full code no worries I I can do a little bit of work okay so okay next fine so all we need actually is this one right there and I mean actually when I just I think it' be fine if I just do PN PMI is going to figure it out sweet y cool so now P TSX we can run this live and see if it changes copy actual code first so main page use client so for sure this is going to need to be modified where is any this just not happy with any I mean chill out a little typescript okay so let's run this Dev see if be amazing If this just works well actually there's no way it's going to work it should complain about the uh missing environment variable still compiling okay so just chill about a bit yeah hang on what are you that's kind of weird why is it not running just Local Host oh no it is okay huh is this a new feature in nextjs latest version because I did at latest because I knew there was a new version of nextjs out I wonder if okay I'll have to look that up later yep so oh seriously okay so this is saying URL y perfect cool so obviously no error handling yet um so yeah uh new file EMV local and file V example and yep my URL good that and I've got something somewhere hav't I yeah in the actual in the back and so okay invalid interpreter selected really I me just that's the one use that relax cool so that's that now oh oh holy it really does work damn okay so actually I need to run the back end um python tinkering is what the VN oh yeah it's the VN interesting okay uh back whatever what is it python back there we go oh no because of course I have to activate the VM again which you do with python M nope okay actually uh python should remember this at some point oh here we go minus MVM VM Source okay so actually not this Source VN beenin activate really um okay um John again let's go okay this definitely needs okay that's doing okay because I didn't disable the okay no worries hello anyone there that can hear me okay oh okay actually I really need to fix this hello it's anyone there hello is anyone there yes I'm here I'm here sweet okay this is a good start you know what this is this is good enough here a thing so sun setting in folon um so thing is like today actually my birthday so I've got some like cake to be eating and some chilling to get done so I'm going to leave it here for now I'll put this on GitHub and I'll get back to it tomorrow um yeah can't imagine anyone actually watched this and found it useful but you know eventually when I actually develop some competence in this these Frameworks might be able to put together some decent tutorials and also like an actual product so okay so I think actually it would be good to prepare this to put up so is there a GE ignore okay well not not n start yep that so in example is there actually no let's leave that and do not n do example for safety cool yeah okay that'll do um pretty sure that's the only thing out okay so what's up here got initial commit I've got bunch of stuff okay actually want to make another Branch because I just always have a Dev Branch out of habit and the from the dev Branch if I if things get hectic I'll make a feature Branch but it's just me working on this so you know it's just for my own purposes okay so I'm using Source Tree in my other screen I'm just going to add an existing local repository the front end okay and also add the back end okay the back end yeah the back end is not there's no get thing here so get in it okay okay well cursor need your help okay write me a get ignore for this python project actually what do I need to use this just I need a um please write me a write me a GU ignore I can copy and paste for a python project needs to no VNV and EnV but keep m. example so I going pipe c pipe C front end the back and why not it'll do I might make another project when I actually figure things out and what I'm doing and all that okay new file don't get ignore okay wow that's a bit what is that yeah because the G ignore is actually in the reposit yet is it so let's just whoa okay so I have to add to get ignore first maybe where is it okay actually we have to do this from Source tree add existing local repository get back end the back end so sorcer knows what's up cuz it's read the get ignore so let's just do thiss maybe I should do a read me as well um cool so let's have a look could you make me a read me I think this is going to be able to do this I think I'm going to need composer to actually do this the agent um and I'll do the initial commits and then add the read me why not you write me a simple readme.md this project explaining how to install it maybe I should have told it where the code is um okay that'll do thank you um don't know what this is about it doesn't actually pep eight nope I mean all due respect um but the line width I'm not using an 81 character line width um good enough my license information here MIT obviously yeah okay I'll do um I mean come on seriously feel like it's not detected the change let's close this new window back end thank you okay all right so that's going to go up on my GitHub let's do the other one reading MD um okay so okay look I going to explain this all right look so could you just update the read me do MD to reflect we're using pnpm as the package manager and also we're setting up a daily Bots chat room in page DSX let's see what it does cool I'll do for today okay and Joiner whatever it's well expressed but whatever okay um I think that's pretty much it I'm going to delete all my API Keys edit out some bits where I show some private information and then put this video on YouTube and yeah cool so I'll be back tomorrow cheerio"
